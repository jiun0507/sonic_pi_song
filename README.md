This is my attempt at making a song using sonic pi program. 

How to play the song.
- play the creative_song.wav
- play the code on Song on Sonic pi player.

Intro to the song:
It's a song that has no melody but has diverse chord progressions, rhythms and background
instruments with experimental tones. The chord progressions has some gospel or pop influences
since those are some of my influences. It doensn't have any melodies or lyrics but it is a 
feel good song that we can all study to or listen without much thoughts.
